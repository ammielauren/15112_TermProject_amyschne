Music-based side scrolling game

Amy Schneider

Project Description & Title:
“Melody in Motion”
Given a selected .wav audio file, the program creates a unique path based on pitch which the player follows and thrown projectiles which collide with the player on the beat.

How to run the project:
Run the file “currentGameWithModes” and click to start (i.e. to exit the SplashScreen and enter GameMode)
Pick a song (out of 3 options) by clicking on its box (the songs are already in the TP3 folder, in the “SampleAudio” folder)
	Program will then start running and is playable (Space to attack)

What libraries I am using:
	Aubio for audio analysis
	Scipy for creating a smooth curve function
	Tkinter for animating the game
	Winsound to play the audio during game
(Also used Medibang Paint Pro to draw the game, excluding
the basic shapes)

Shortcut Commands:
  Shift-S ('S') gives longer explanation of game, printed both in canvas and in console
